Thank you for visiting my Github!  Here you will see the repository of the project I have been working on since January 1st 2020.  Please feel free to check out my project plan as well:

Please note, the music was taken from an already existing game, Final Fantasy 7, and is simply a placeholder.  The sound effects and graphics were all largely taken from the Unity Asset Store, which you can find more details from below.  All existing assets are placeholders which will be replaced when the permanent solution has been found.
